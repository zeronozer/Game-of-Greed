"""
Game of Greed code is based on one of the projects presented in a tutorial video, which you can find at the following link: https://youtu.be/21FnnGKSRZo. â†—
I have implemented the project in my own way, with modifications and improvements.
The purpose of this code is to showcase my skills and knowledge in Python programming, and to provide an example of how I approach coding challenges.
